  Currently I'm still working on this website and a few functions still not work. I'm working hard to solve problems and add more functions.
</p> 
<p>
	The way this blog works is:
</p>
<p>
	After administrator(me) logging in, three new buttons will appear: Add Blog, Edit Blog and Delete Blog:
</p>
<img src="./app/images/blog/admin.PNG" style="border-style:dashed;"><br/>
<p>
	After click "Add Blog" button, I will be able to fill a form with blog information then post them to back-end(Node.js) as Json object. This object will be saved to MongoDB(i.e. Mongoose). A get method will then perform to retrieve all blog information from MongoDB and update blog page.
</p>
<p>
    "Edit Blog" and "Delete Blog" will allow me to perform put and delete in back-end.
