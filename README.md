Independent Study Web Project: Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS and MongoDB
=======

Note from Pengyin Shan:


6/5/2014:

Thank you very much for checking this project. Please feel free to view this website at: http://pengyinshan.herokuapp.com.

I began to work on this project from mid April, 2014. I created this website because when I tried to learn Node.js and AnuglarJS in my free time, I realized I may need a blog to post notes and ideas I got in study process. Instead using existing blog platform, I want to create my own.

I started building website using Yeoman framework becuase it has great integration for MEAN stack. I've deployed it to Heroku and I'm still working on implementing more features for it.

Just for reference, "app" folder mainly contains code in front-end (AngularJS). "lib" folder mainly contains code in back-end (Mongoose, Node.js, Express.js).

This website is very basic now and I'm working hard to add a brunch of new feautures in my free time. I'm also in the process of cleaning code.
